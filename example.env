RELAY_DESCRIPTION="The Espelho de São Miguel is the sacred mirror that stands between worlds, where every message is received, reflected, and transmitted without distortion under the Archangel’s vigilant gaze. It unites the power of Exu, opener of paths, with the harmony of Ibeji, the divine twins, ensuring that all light crossing its surface returns as truth."

# Software, version and supported_nips are fixed by this binary:
# - Software: https://gitworkshop.dev/npub18lav8fkgt8424rxamvk8qq4xuy9n8mltjtgztv2w44hc5tt9vets0hcfsz/relay.ngit.dev/saint-michaels-mirror
# - Version: 0.1.0-beta
# - Supported NIPs are taken from khatru defaults and are not configurable here

# Optional: Authentication (for upstream relays)
# Required for relays that need authentication to publish events
# Supports both raw hex (64 chars) and nsec bech32 formats
# 
# Raw hex format (64 characters):
# RELAY_SECKEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
#
# nsec bech32 format (recommended):
# RELAY_SECKEY=nsec13qrrkw4x0myd68235tdltzm24rmuzwxlwg8w45enlmephxj9y08qrruaax
#
# The relay will automatically authenticate with upstream relays when required
# and use this key to sign authentication events (NIP-42).
