Permission to use this software, modify it, and distribute it (or parts of it) is granted to everyone who wishes,
provided that the above copyright notice is kept or the following conditions are met:

1) The software IS modified in any way (note that the removal of the copyright notice is by itself a modification).

2) If the modification is made in the name of one single individual, that person must do one of the following:

   a) Go to a public place (with more than 100 people present) wearing a He-Man costume (the character from the
      animated series) and loudly shout so many people hear: "I have the power". This sentence can be said in English
      or the official translation used in the animated series in the country or region where the person is performing this action.

   b) Go to a public place (with more than 1000 people, such as a sports stadium) naked and run around for at least five
      minutes (unless local authorities arrest the person for any reason, in which case the time will be limited to the time
      it takes for the arrest), while showing a large banner with big letters that can be read by most of the people present
      stating: "I am removing a copyright notice and changing the license of some software".

3) In the case of a company, corporation, or association of any kind making the modification, the president, CEO, or the most important
   person in that association should follow the actions stated in section 2 (for governments in monarchies this would be the king;
   in parliamentary democracies, the prime minister).

Whenever the steps in 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, are accomplished, this license no longer applies to the software and it can be used by the
person (in case 2) or the company/association (in case 3) in any way they wish, as if the piece of software were in the public domain.

This software and all associated documentation, files and whatever ships with it is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN AN USEFUL WAY!
If, for any reason, it happens to be useful to you and does not destroy your life or cause monetary loss, you should be thanking
all the gods of your current religion, if any, or the intelligence of human kind and creativity if you are an atheist.
