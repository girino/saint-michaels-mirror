# Release Notes - Espelho de S√£o Miguel v1.4.0

**Release Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Version**: 1.4.0  
**Codename**: "The Divider of Worlds"

---

## üåü Overview

Version 1.4.0 represents a fundamental architectural shift in the Espelho de S√£o Miguel, introducing a complete separation of query and publish responsibilities, along with a custom JSON library for ordered data structures and a global stats collection system. This release transforms the relay into a more modular, maintainable, and flexible system with improved statistics tracking and health monitoring, plus performance optimizations and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

## üöÄ Major Features

### ‚ö° Performance & Scalability Enhancements

**Auto-Scaling Broadcast Workers:**
- Broadcast worker count now automatically defaults to 2√ó the number of CPU cores
- Optimizes performance based on available system resources
- No manual tuning required for most deployments
- Scale automatically with your hardware

**Mandatory Relay Support:**
- `BROADCAST_MANDATORY_RELAYS` configuration now properly registers mandatory relays with the broadcast manager
- Ensures critical relays always receive events regardless of their performance score
- Essential for ensuring events reach specific relays (e.g., your own relay or backup systems)
- Configurable per-deployment needs

### üìä Enhanced Monitoring & Statistics

**Execution Time Tracking:**
- Comprehensive execution time statistics for broadcaststore operations (SaveEvent)
- Matches the monitoring pattern used in relaystore for consistency
- Tracks average and total execution times for performance analysis
- Excludes cached events from timing for accurate metrics

**Stats Page Improvements:**
- New "Avg Save Duration" metric in Performance section
- New "Total Save Time" metric for cumulative tracking
- Performance statistics logically grouped with averages first, then totals
- Better visibility into broadcast performance

**Updated Dependencies:**
- Upgraded to nostr-lib with execution time tracking support
- Better performance visibility across all operations

### üéØ Separation of Query and Publish Stores

**What's New:**
- **RelayStore** is now query-only: No longer handles event publishing, only queries remote relays for events
- **BroadcastStore** handles all event publishing: Uses a sophisticated broadcast system that discovers and ranks relays
- Clear separation of concerns: Each store has a single, well-defined responsibility

**Benefits:**
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Better Performance**: Specialized implementations for query vs. publish operations
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear boundaries between components
- **Flexible Configuration**: Choose which stores to use based on your needs

**Technical Details:**
- `RelayStore`: Query-only, forwards events from remote relays to clients
- `BroadcastStore`: Publish-only, broadcasts events to the best available relays
- Both stores implement the `eventstore.Store` interface
- Both provide statistics via the global stats collector

### üìä Custom JSON Library with Ordered Structures

**What's New:**
- Complete custom JSON library in `nostr-lib/json`
- Ordered `JsonObject` type that preserves field insertion order
- Type-safe `JsonValue` and `JsonList` types
- All stats providers now use `JsonEntity` instead of `interface{}`

**Benefits:**
- **Order Preservation**: Statistics are displayed in a consistent, meaningful order
- **Type Safety**: No more `interface{}` type assertions
- **Predictable Output**: JSON output is deterministic and ordered
- **Better Debugging**: Consistent field ordering makes stats easier to read

**Architecture:**
```go
type JsonEntity interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}

type JsonValue struct {
    // Supports: int, float, string, bool, null
}

type JsonObject struct {
    // Ordered map of string keys to JsonEntity values
    // Preserves insertion order
}

type JsonList struct {
    // Ordered list of JsonEntity values
}
```

### üìà Global Stats Collection System

**What's New:**
- Singleton `StatsCollector` accessible via `stats.GetCollector()`
- All components register themselves as `StatsProvider`s
- Unified statistics endpoint with ordered JSON output
- Health endpoint uses stats collector directly

**Benefits:**
- **Unified View**: All statistics in one place
- **Automatic Registration**: Components self-register with the global collector
- **Consistent API**: Single API for accessing all statistics
- **Performance**: Efficient, thread-safe singleton pattern

**Stats Providers:**
- `RelayStore`: Query statistics (requests, failures, timing)
- `BroadcastStore`: Publish statistics (attempts, successes, health)
- `BroadcastManager`: Active relay management statistics
- `Broadcaster`: Event broadcasting statistics
- `MirrorManager`: Event mirroring statistics
- `AppStats`: Application runtime statistics

### üè• Enhanced Health Monitoring

**What's New:**
- Health states now include broadcast store health
- Three-tier color system (Green, Yellow, Red) based on failure thresholds
- Main health state considers all components (query, publish, mirror, broadcast)
- More granular health indicators for each subsystem

**Health Logic:**
- **GREEN**: All systems operational, no failures
- **YELLOW**: Some failures detected but within acceptable threshold
- **RED**: Critical failures exceeding acceptable threshold

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: Healthy or degraded
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Unhealthy

### ‚öôÔ∏è Improved Configuration System

**What's New:**
- All environment variables now have corresponding command-line flags
- Consistent naming: `--flag-name` for CLI, `FLAG_NAME` for environment
- Updated configuration parameters:
  - `MAX_PUBLISH_RELAYS` (was `BROADCAST_TOP_N`): Maximum relays for publishing
  - Removed `PUBLISH_REMOTES`: Now handled by broadcast discovery
  - Simplified `RelayStore` configuration

**Configuration Priority:**
1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
2. Environment variables (defaults)
3. Built-in defaults (fallback)

**New Flags:**
- `--max-publish-relays`: Maximum number of top relays for publishing
- `--broadcast-workers`: Number of worker goroutines
- `--broadcast-cache-ttl`: Cache TTL for broadcast events
- `--broadcast-seed-relays`: Seed relays for broadcast discovery
- `--broadcast-mandatory-relays`: Mandatory relays for broadcasting

## üîß Technical Changes

### Architecture Refactoring

**Before:**
```
RelayStore (Query + Publish)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Query Remotes
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Publish Remotes
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Direct publish to upstream relays
```

**After:**
```
RelayStore (Query Only)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Query Remotes

BroadcastStore (Publish Only)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BroadcastSystem
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Discover relays from seeds
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rank relays by success rate

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Upgraders

**If using only query functionality:**
- No changes needed
- Continue using `QUERY_REMOTES` environment variable
- Remove `PUBLISH_REMOTES` from your configuration

**If using publish functionality:**
1. Add `BROADCAST_SEED_RELAYS` environment variable
2. Remove `PUBLISH_REMOTES` environment variable
3. Update `BROADCAST_TOP_N` to `MAX_PUBLISH_RELAYS`
4. Configure `--broadcast-seed-relays` for broadcast discovery
5. (Optional) Set `BROADCAST_MANDATORY_RELAYS` for critical relays
6. (Optional) Configure `BROADCAST_WORKERS` (defaults to 2√ó CPU cores)

**Example Migration:**

**Before:**
```bash
QUERY_REMOTES=wss://relay1.com,wss://relay2.com
PUBLISH_REMOTES=wss://relay1.com,wss://relay2.com
BROADCAST_TOP_N=10
```

**After:**
```bash
QUERY_REMOTES=wss://relay1.com,wss://relay2.com
MAX_PUBLISH_RELAYS=10
BROADCAST_SEED_RELAYS=wss://relay.damus.io,wss://relay.nostr.band
BROADCAST_MANDATORY_RELAYS=wss://relay1.com
# BROADCAST_WORKERS defaults to 2 √ó CPU cores (auto-scaling)
```

### For Developers

**RelayStore:**
