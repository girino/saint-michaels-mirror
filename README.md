> The Espelho de S√£o Miguel is the sacred mirror that stands between worlds, where every message is received, reflected, and transmitted without distortion under the Archangel‚Äôs vigilant gaze. It unites the power of Exu, opener of paths, with the harmony of Ibeji, the divine twins, ensuring that all light crossing its surface returns as truth.

**Espelho de S√£o Miguel** is a Nostr relay aggregator built on the [khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru) framework. It acts as a mirror between worlds, forwarding events between multiple Nostr relays while providing a unified interface for Nostr applications.

## üîê Authentication & Mirroring Features

### Authentication Passthrough
The relay automatically authenticates with upstream relays when required using the configured `RELAY_SECKEY`. This enables seamless operation with relays that require authentication for publishing events.

**Supported Key Formats:**
- **Raw Hex**: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...` (64-character hex string)
- **nsec Bech32**: `nsec1abc123...` (bech32 encoded secret key)

The relay automatically detects and decodes nsec keys to hex format for authentication, ensuring compatibility with both formats.

### Event Mirroring
The relay continuously mirrors events from query relays using a "since now" filter, providing comprehensive event coverage. Mirrored events are injected into the local relay via `khatru.BroadcastEvent()` and counted in statistics.

**Mirroring Benefits:**
- **Complete Coverage**: Ensures all events from query relays are available locally
- **Real-time Updates**: Events are mirrored immediately as they arrive
- **Deduplication**: Automatic deduplication prevents duplicate events
- **Statistics Tracking**: Mirroring activity is tracked in the stats endpoint

### Structured Error Handling
When all publish attempts fail, the relay returns machine-readable error prefixes from upstream relays (NIP-01 standard), including: `duplicate`, `pow`, `blocked`, `rate-limited`, `invalid`, `restricted`, `mute`, `error`, and `auth-required`.

**Error Format**: `prefix: message (relay-url)` - includes the source relay URL for context.

## üåê Web Interface

Once running, visit your relay in a web browser:

- **Main Page** (`/`): Relay information and NIP-11 metadata
- **Statistics** (`/stats`): Real-time performance metrics and counters
- **Health** (`/health`): Health status and failure tracking
- **API** (`/api/v1/stats`, `/api/v1/health`): JSON endpoints for monitoring

### Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics and health pages auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **NIP-11 Compliance**: Standard relay information endpoint
- **Health Monitoring**: Visual indicators for relay health status
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed timing and counter statistics

## üìä Monitoring and Health

### Health States

The relay monitors its own health and reports status:

- **üü¢ GREEN**: No failures, all operations successful
- **üü° YELLOW**: Some failures detected, but below threshold
- **üî¥ RED**: Critical failures, relay marked as unhealthy

### Metrics Available

- **Operation Counters**: Attempts, successes, failures for all operations
- **Timing Statistics**: Average, minimum, maximum operation times
- **System Resources**: Memory usage, goroutine counts, GC statistics
- **Remote Connectivity**: Status of connected remote relays
- **Failure Tracking**: Consecutive failure counts with automatic recovery
- **Mirroring Statistics**: Mirrored events, mirror attempts, successes, and failures
- **Relay Health**: Live/dead relay counts and mirroring health state

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Conceptual Mapping

The relay implements a spiritual metaphor through technical architecture:

- **Mirror**: Published events are accepted and forwarded (mirrored) to remote relays
- **Archangel**: Reliable, accountable message transmission and metadata signing
- **Ibeji Twins**: Mirroring and duplication through copying and distribution
- **Exu**: Opening of paths and active communication with other relays

### Technical Implementation

- **Event Forwarding**: Concurrent forwarding to multiple remote relays
- **Query Aggregation**: Merging responses from multiple query sources
- **Health Monitoring**: Failure tracking with configurable thresholds
- **Metrics Collection**: Atomic counters for all operations
- **Smart Routing**: Internal vs. external query differentiation
