# Espelho de S√£o Miguel - Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0-rc2

**Release Date**: January 2025

## üéâ What is Espelho de S√£o Miguel?

Espelho de S√£o Miguel is a Nostr relay aggregator built on the khatru framework. It acts as a mirror between worlds, forwarding events between multiple Nostr relays while providing a unified interface for Nostr applications.

The name comes from a spiritual metaphor: the sacred mirror that stands between worlds, where every message is received, reflected, and transmitted without distortion under the Archangel's vigilant gaze.
