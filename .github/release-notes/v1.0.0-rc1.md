# v1.0.0-rc1 (draft)

First release candidate establishing the project’s myth and core goal.

Myth and Goal

- Afro‑Brazilian myth: the sacred mirror between worlds (Espelho de São Miguel).
- Goal: a Nostr relay that does not store events — it fetches from multiple remote relays and mirrors them.

Summary highlights

- Relay: forward publishes to configured remotes; aggregate queries from multiple remotes.
- NIP‑11: served at `/` via `Accept: application/nostr+json`.
- Observability: `/stats` counters and `/health` endpoint.
- Packaging: Dockerfile, Docker Compose, `example.env`, initial assets/UI.

Changes (grouped)

Features
- Mirror events from multiple upstream relays (no local storage).
- Aggregate QueryEvents (unified stream back to clients) via a pool of upstream relays.
- Forward CountEvents to remotes; support NIP‑45 Count when upstreams advertise it.

Behavior/Fixes
- Avoid forwarding internal bookkeeping queries to upstreams (short‑circuit internal QueryEvents, including the exact adding.kind=5/#e case handling).
- Separate counters for queries vs. counts; track failures and returned events.

Docs & Assets
- README with myth and goals; server‑rendered homepage with NIP‑11 info and foldable stats UI.
- Icon/SVG variants; generated favicons.

CI & Release
- Initial build/test workflow and basic release automation producing platform binaries.
- Idempotent release behavior and pinned toolchain for reproducibility.
