# v1.2.1 — Bug Fix Release

This is a bug fix release that addresses a critical issue with the web interface statistics display.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed MirrorManager Statistics Display
- **Issue**: MirrorManager statistics and health status were not appearing on the web interface statistics page
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript was incorrectly accessing mirror statistics from `data.relay` instead of `data.mirror`
- **Fix**: Corrected JavaScript data access paths to properly display:
  - Mirror statistics (mirrored events, attempts, successes, failures)
  - Mirror health status and consecutive failure counts
  - Live/dead relay counts for mirroring operations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
The web interface JavaScript was accessing mirror statistics using incorrect data paths:
- **Before**: `data.relay.mirrored_events` (undefined)
- **After**: `data.mirror.mirrored_events` (correct)

### Affected Components
- Statistics page (`/stats`) - Mirror statistics section
- Health monitoring - Mirror health status indicators
- Web interface JavaScript (`stats-page.js`)

## 📊 Impact

- **User Experience**: Mirror statistics now properly displayed on web interface
- **Monitoring**: Health status of mirroring operations now visible
- **Debugging**: Better visibility into mirroring performance and issues

## 🚀 Upgrade Path
