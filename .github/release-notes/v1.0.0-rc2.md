# v1.0.0-rc2 (draft)

Changelog

- Build: Bump embedded version to v1.0.0-rc2.
- Release: Upload platform-specific binaries separately rather than a single archive.
- CI: Replace release creation with replace-on-exist behavior to ensure idempotent runs.
- CI: Use curl-based uploads to avoid action resolution issues and support restricted runner images.

Notes

- This is a release candidate. Please test the binaries for Linux (amd64/arm64), macOS (amd64/arm64), and Windows (amd64).
- If approved, create the tag `v1.0.0-rc2` to trigger the release workflow.
